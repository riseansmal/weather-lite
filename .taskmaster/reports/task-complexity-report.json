			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Next.js Project with TypeScript",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js initialization into: 1) Run create-next-app with specific flags, 2) Install core dependencies (zod, clsx, radix-ui), 3) Configure TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json, 4) Update next.config.js for experimental features and CSP headers",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward initialization task using Next.js CLI. The complexity is low as it's mostly running commands and making configuration file edits. The 4 subtasks already defined are appropriate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Environment Variables and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Create .env.local with all weather app environment variables, 2) Create lib/constants.ts with weather code mappings and configuration constants, 3) Implement Zod validation schemas for environment variables",
			"reasoning": "Simple file creation and configuration task. No complex logic required, just setting up configuration files and basic validation. The 3 subtasks cover all necessary aspects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Install and Configure shadcn/ui Components",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Initialize shadcn/ui with New York style and Zinc color scheme, 2) Add required components (Button, Card, Skeleton, Input), 3) Configure cn() utility function, 4) Update Tailwind configuration for theming",
			"reasoning": "Standard shadcn/ui setup process with CLI commands. The complexity is low as it's mostly following documented procedures. The 4 subtasks already defined are well-structured."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Location Detection System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement: 1) TypeScript interfaces for Location types, 2) Browser geolocation API wrapper with error handling, 3) IP-based location fallback service, 4) Fallback chain orchestration logic, 5) Default location configuration and permission management",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to multiple APIs, fallback logic, error handling, and permission management. Requires careful implementation of async operations and fallback chain. The 5 subtasks provide good coverage."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Weather API Integration Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build: 1) TypeScript interfaces for weather data structures, 2) Zod schemas for API response validation, 3) Open-Meteo API client with fetch and timeout, 4) Weather code to condition mapping, 5) Data transformation layer",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving API integration, data validation, transformation, and error handling. Requires understanding Open-Meteo API structure and implementing robust data handling. The 5 subtasks cover all essential aspects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build In-Memory Cache System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create: 1) LRU Cache class with Map-based storage, 2) TTL expiration logic with timestamp tracking, 3) Cache key generation and validation, 4) Cache eviction and memory management",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity implementing LRU cache algorithm with TTL. Requires understanding of cache strategies and memory management. The 4 subtasks appropriately break down the implementation."

			"expansionPrompt": "Develop: 1) CurrentWeather component, 2) ForecastCard component, 3) Weather icon mapping system, 4) Loading skeleton components, 5) Main WeatherDisplay container, 6) Responsive layout styles",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to multiple React components, client/server component separation, responsive design, and accessibility requirements. The 6 subtasks ensure comprehensive UI implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Location Selection and Search",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build: 1) LocationSelector component structure, 2) Geocoding API integration, 3) Input validation and debouncing, 4) Error handling and user feedback, 5) Integration with main weather display",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with API integration, form handling, validation, and UX considerations. The 5 subtasks provide thorough coverage of functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add Refresh and Auto-Refresh Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement: 1) RefreshButton component with cooldown timer, 2) useAutoRefresh custom hook, 3) Document visibility detection, 4) Integration with weather data fetching",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward implementation of timers and event listeners. The complexity is moderate due to state management and timer coordination. The 4 subtasks are well-defined."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Dark Mode and Responsive Design",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create: 1) ThemeProvider component with context, 2) CSS custom properties for theming, 3) Theme toggle component, 4) Responsive breakpoints and mobile styles",
			"reasoning": "Standard dark mode implementation with CSS variables and responsive design. Complexity is moderate due to theming system and responsive requirements. The 4 subtasks cover all aspects."

			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Create API Route and Error Boundaries",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build: 1) Next.js API route with validation, 2) Weather data fetching logic, 3) Error boundary component, 4) Global error handling and fallback UI",
